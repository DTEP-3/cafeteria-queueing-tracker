# Design problem
 The campus of Aalto University in Espoo, Finland, provides catering services in cafeterias to its large student body of over 15,000 students, with a system that includes more than 30 dining areas.. Empirical evidence indicates that visitors at some cafeterias on the campus experience long waiting times during peak hours, while at others waiting periods are negligible. Extended queue times also result in a number of problems that, in general, can lead to poor nutritional habits, such as problems with declining attendance for subsequent classes, increased stress levels, and discouragement from utilizing cafeteria services. 
# The solution:
 Our team proposes a system of monitoring the number of visitors in the catering locations on the university’s campus and predicting the waiting times to address the problem of long queues. The system provides the data to the potential visitors allowing them to choose less crowded locations or rearrange their schedules knowing the waiting time in advance. In this way, the system passively distributes people across the cafeterias, reducing waiting times and improving customer satisfaction. The concept we present is unique as there are currently no similar solutions for cafeterias in the Otaniemi area.
